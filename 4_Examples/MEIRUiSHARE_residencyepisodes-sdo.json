    "abstract": "The Karonga Health and Demographic Surveillance System (Karonga HDSS) in northern Malawi currently has a population of more than 38 000 individuals under continuous demographic surveillance since completion of a baseline census (2002-2004). The surveillance system collects data on vital events and migration for individuals and for households. It also provides data on cause-specific mortality obtained by verbal autopsy for all age groups, and estimates rates of disease for specific presentations via linkage to clinical facility data. The Karonga HDSS provides a structure for surveys of socio-economic status, HIV-prevalence and incidence, sexual behavior, fertility intentions and a sampling frame for other studies, as well as evaluating the impact of interventions, such as antiretroviral therapy and vaccination programs. Uniquely, it relies on a network of village informants to report vital events and household moves, and furthermore is linked to an archive of biological samples and data from population surveys and other studies dating back three decades.",
    "description": "This is one of many LongDataSet recipes. With event and episodic data a LongDataSet contains just one or two measures that are the same from one record to the next. In both cases the measure(s) are conditioned by time -- either an instant or an interval. So each row of a LongDataSet contains either an event or an episode (consisting of a start event and an end event) together with attributes for a start date and an end date that defines the instant/interval. Additionally, a LongDataSet has one or more unit identifiers. These identifiers together with the measure(s) are the key of a LongDataSet record. Additionally, a LongDataSet optionally includes one or more dimensions that repeat for the same unit from one record to the next -- e.g. sex and race of a person. These dimensions are convenience variables for sorting/filtering a LongDataSet. ",
